Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 48 out of 50 = 96% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1, there are a couple of things you didn't fix:
   the word 'provate' should be 'private'
   the word 'If' should be 'if'
   The comments could be condensed into a reference to the wikipedia page

problem 7-5, good analysis on this problem, very complete!

problem 8-11, the lincoln index is based on pairs, so you would need to do
   the following calculations:
      Testing the three different Lincoln indexes:
      Alice/Bob 5*4/2 =10
      Alice/Carmen 5*5/2 = 12.5
      Bob/Carmen 4*5/1 = 20
   To estimate the bug you take the average of the three.
   In this case, there are 14 bugs.

Nice work on this assignment!  You earned 10.56 extra credit points.
