Not bad.....

On problem 4.2, the duration should be 32 days, not 39.  The critical path
   should be G, D, E, M, and Q.

On problem 4.8, the two things are failing to address a task that is behind,
   and adding people to an already late project.

On problem 5.3, your answers are inconsistent with the book's answers.  For
   the list given as is, the assignments should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F

Nice work on the MoSCoW for Mr. Bones!

Good job overall, so don't be discouraged.
