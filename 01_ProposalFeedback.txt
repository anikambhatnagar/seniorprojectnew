Project Proposal Feedback
Project:
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Oh, this is very nice!  I like that you are starting with a cover letter.
   The organization of the document is VERY professional and hits all the
   right notes for a project proposal.  The section approach is a great way
   to organize the information.  VERY well done!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   The presentation is nice.  I like the minimalist approach with just B&W
   on the slides.  Even still, it could be dressed up a bit with some nice
   graphics, especially since this is a visual journaling application.  You
   could put a picture or two that shows the emotional link between the
   different emotions your AI might reflect, for example.

   The other thing is you don't really highlight the daily quote as the new
   part for this semester.  I see it in there with the other components, but
   you don't actually say "this is the new part" on that slide.  You DID say
   that out loud in the presentation, though, so OK...

   One thing to remember, TALK LOUDER.  For you two who are naturally kinda
   quiet, it will probably seem like you're yelling, but believe me, it won't
   seem that way to the audience, especially in a room this large.  Give it a
   try next time!

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  REALLY good job on the document.  Great start so keep it up.
