Since this updated document doesn't use the same numbering as its previous
version, it is difficult to tell if you added anything or not.  Your 4071
document has lots of good design information.  All you had to do was make
a copy of that document for 4072 and update it to add anything new from
this semester.  Your 4072 document has no diagrams, you have some details,
but there are not enough new details to lay out exactly what is new.

Feel free to come to office hours if you want some advice on this.
