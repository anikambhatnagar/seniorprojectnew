Comments:
---------

problem 5-1, you got component-based, but where is server-based to contrast?

problem 5-2, you have made your case for the three architectures you have
   listed, but all you really need for this is a simple monolithic architecture.

problem 5-4, I think you are over-thinking this one.  This is a server-based
   architecture problem since all that is needed is two player clients and a
   server to keep track of game mechanics.

problem 5-8, what about floating point exponents like 1.23e-1.5?

problem 6-2, you have the wrong problem ~ you should have drawn a diagram for
   the inheritance of ClassyDraw.  However, what you wrote is basically right
   for that wrong problem...  :D

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
